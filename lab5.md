## Reflection

In the second half of this quarter I learned how to use Vim and it is such an interesting concept. 
But by far the most shocking thing I learned was how to generate log in keys so that I wasn't promted to enter a password everytime I logged in.
It made remote connecting such an easy task becuase logging in could be a hassle with not being able to see the password.
