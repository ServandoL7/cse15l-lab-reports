**Part 3: What I learned**
- In the week 2 lab I learned how to initialize a server and get it running. 
- I was able to create a unique URL for my personal server and get it to run as well as change the URL to manipulate what was shown.
- In the week 3 lab I learned how to search for bugs on code and edit the code to fix the bugs.
